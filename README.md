-Add unlimited number of stations (default: 9)<br><br>
-Play/Stop buttons<br><br>
-Volume Control<br><br>
-Metadata (https://github.com/eshaz/icecast-metadata-js) Included<br><br>
-Visualizer (https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer) Included <br><br>
-Rainbow Color Changer

It will play any internet radio stream, however metadata only shows on stations that don't enforce the cors policy.<br><br>

"Unfortunately, there is no way to support cross-orgin ICY metadata from stations that don't have CORS configured 
to allow cross-origin / the Icy-Metadata header, since this is a browser enforced security feature. These streams 
play in a desktop app because CORS is not being enforced by the app your using."
